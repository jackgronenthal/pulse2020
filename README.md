# Pulse 2020 Registration Form

A custom registration form built for the ECE department's Pulse technology conference. Made in React, it's a light hearted, creative way to engage participants before the event even began. I was excited to put some of my web development skills to work incorporating REST APIs, input validation/sanitation, and database transaction. I hope you enjoy!
